Important: This app only works with the PSN version game files and may or may not work with blu ray disc version files.

Single Mode:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Select the mp3 audio file that you want to encode from the first box. the selected audio file shouldn't have any metadata or 
  cover art attached to it and the bitrate should be 256kbps or below. you can use a tool like Mp3tag to remove 
  the metadata or cover art from the mp3 file before selecting it from this app.


- Select the .XXX audio file that you want to replace from the second box. the music files are all stored inside 
  the "USRDIR\SQEX03GAME\COOKEDSOUND\" folder and their filenames either begin with 'BGM_' or 'MUSIC_'.


- Select the PS3TOC.TXT file from the third box. this text file is present inside the "USRDIR\SQEX03GAME\" folder.
  
 
- After you are done selecting the files, the conversion tools should all be interactable. 


- Under the mp3 settings, set the correct sample rate and the number of channels present on the mp3 file. 
  you can use the 'Load from mp3' option to automatically load the values from the mp3 file.


- Under the Game audio settings, you have the option of using either the volume level from the file that 
  you are replacing or set a custom volume level with the slider. 


- The loop start and end options are experimental and if you want the game to repeat the music track after 
  it has played once, then tinker with these two loop options. the value has to be entered in bytes that is less 
  than or equal to the mp3 file's size.

  
- Once you have set all of the options correctly, click on the convert button. if the conversion is successful, then 
  you will get a success message and the XXX audio file and the TOC file will be updated accordingly. 
  the XXX audio file and the TOC file prior to the conversion, will be renamed with a .old extension.


- And that's it. you have successfully added in a custom music track into this game.
