Important: This app only works with the PSN version game files and may or may not work with blu ray disc version files.

Single Mode:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Select the mp3 audio file that you want to encode from the first box. the selected audio file shouldn't have any metadata or 
  cover art attached to it and the bitrate should be 256kbps or below. you can use a tool like Mp3tag to remove 
  the metadata or cover art from the mp3 file before selecting it from this app.


- Select the .XXX audio file that you want to replace from the second box. the music files are all stored inside 
  the "USRDIR\SQEX03GAME\COOKEDSOUND\" folder and their filenames either begin with 'BGM_' or 'MUSIC_'.


- Select the PS3TOC.TXT file from the third box. this text file is present inside the "USRDIR\SQEX03GAME\" folder.
  
 
- Under the mp3 settings, set the correct sample rate and the number of channels present on the mp3 file. 
  you can use the 'Load from mp3' option to automatically load the values from the mp3 file.


- Under the Game audio settings, you have the option of using either the volume level from the file that 
  you are replacing or set a custom volume level with the slider. 


- The loop start and end options are experimental and if you want the game to repeat the music track after 
  it has played once, then tinker with these two loop options. the value has to be entered in bytes that is less 
  than or equal to the mp3 file's size.

  
- Once you have set all of the options correctly, click on the Convert Audio button. if the conversion is successful, then 
  you will get a success message and the XXX audio file and the TOC file will be updated accordingly. 
  the XXX audio file and the TOC file prior to the conversion, will be renamed with a .old extension.


- And that's it. you have successfully added in a custom music track into this game.



Batch Mode:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Select the directory containing the mp3 audio files that you want to encode from the first box. the mp3 files should have 
  the same name as the XXX audio files that you are trying to replace.
  
  For example, if you are replacing the audio file "MUSIC_OTHER_TITLE_SCD.XXX", then your mp3 file should be 
  named as "MUSIC_OTHER_TITLE_SCD.mp3".

  The mp3 files shouldn't have any metadata or cover art attached to it and the bitrate should be 256kbps or below. 
  you can use a tool like Mp3tag to remove the metadata or cover art from the mp3 files.


- The program will automatically load the required mp3 settings from the mp3 file in Batch mode. the volume level will be 
  set to the same value that is given in the original .XXX audio file.
  
  You can specify an optional text file containing the mp3 settings required by this program, next to the mp3 file. this file
  should have the same name as the mp3 file.
  
  For example, if the mp3 file is "MUSIC_OTHER_TITLE_SCD.mp3", then your text file should be named as ""MUSIC_OTHER_TITLE_SCD.txt".

  Each line in the text file, should have a numerical value for each setting that is required by this program. 
  The settings are as follows:
  * SampleRate
  * ChannelCount
  * Volume
  * LoopStart
  * LoopEnd

  For example, if the mp3 file has a sample rate of 48000hz, has a Stereo channel layout and has loop points, then each line 
  in your text file should be as follows:
  48000
  2
  0.64
  174336
  2065536

  + If you are specifying the text file, then make sure to provide all of the above settings.
  + You can specify -1 for the Volume setting if you want to use the same value given in the original .XXX file. 
  + You can speciy 0 for the LoopStart and LoopEnd values if you do not have loop points for your mp3 file.


- Once you have finished setting up the mp3 files, select the directory containing the the .XXX audio files that you want to 
  replace from the second box. the music files are all stored inside the "USRDIR\SQEX03GAME\COOKEDSOUND\" folder and 
  their filenames either begin with 'BGM_' or 'MUSIC_'.


- Select the PS3TOC.TXT file from the third box. this text file is present inside the "USRDIR\SQEX03GAME\" folder.


- Once you have set all of the options correctly, click on the Convert Files button. if the conversion is successful, then 
  you will get a success message and the XXX audio files and the TOC file will be updated accordingly. 
  the XXX audio files and the TOC file prior to the conversion, will be renamed with a .old extension.


- And that's it. you have successfully added in multiple custom music tracks into this game.
